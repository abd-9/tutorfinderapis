### Main Idea: 
The objective of this software project is to develop a tutor-finding application that facilitates the process of connecting students with suitable tutors. The application will enable students to search for tutors based on study level, courses, geographical area, teacher ratings, and cost per hour. By providing a user-friendly platform, the application aims to enhance the efficiency and effectiveness of finding tutors, ultimately supporting students in their educational journey.
